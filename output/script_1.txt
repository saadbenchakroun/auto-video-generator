Not everyone who triggers you is toxic ... some people just expose where you’re still unhealed.

It’s easy to label discomfort as danger, but growth often feels unsafe because your nervous system confuses peace with boredom and consistency with control.

Sometimes the lesson is: “You’re not being mistreated ... you’re just not used to being respected.”

Don’t run from every trigger. Some are teachers disguised as discomfort.

Which recent trigger might actually be trying to teach you something?
